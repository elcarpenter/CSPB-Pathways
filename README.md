# CSPB-Pathways

Project Title: 

CSPB pathway generator



Team Members:
- Emily Carpenter: elcarpenter 
- Guanbo Bian: gbian2
- Ryan Young: RyanColoradoCS


Vision Statement:

- Help students be able to take all of the classes they want given their current progress and graduation plan;
- Help students get class information and class difficulty level;
- Help students get a balanced schedule 


Motivation:
- Prospective/current students need class information to make a plan for finishing the program. They should have access to information that allowes them to take the courses they need, the electives that align with their interests, and those that are balanced against their work schedule. 


Risks:

- Small group with limited experience in development 
- We are all in different time zones with 7-hour differences
- Limited data on difficulty/time per week for each class may lead to it not being accurate
- To get final class schedule from program
- We might give bad advice 

Mitigation Strategy:
- We can reach out to our advisor about future class availability
- We will do all of our class readings and watch all of our lectures, so that we all develop foundational knowledge in all the areas in which we will need to work 
- We can do surveys and collect information from current students on social media (reddit, discord, etc.)
- Will communicate with program advisor on final class schedule plan (which classes will be open in Spring semester, Fall semester â€¦ )


Development Method:
- Agile method. 

- We will use Python flask or HTML.

- We plan to meet every two weeks at the beginning and once per week in the last few weeks. In each meeting, we will summarize what we finish, in terms of data collection, graph interface design.


Project Tracking Software:

- GitHub Project 
- Trello
